# 👁️‍🗨️ Face Counter

A simple computer vision project that detects and counts faces in images using OpenCV and Python.

This project processes input images, detects all human faces, draws bounding boxes around them, and displays the total count of detected faces — making it useful for basic image analysis and vision tasks.

---

## 📌 Overview

Face Counter uses a face detection algorithm to identify and count the number of human faces in a given image. Whether for fun or learning computer vision, this project demonstrates how to apply OpenCV tools for real-world image processing.

## 🚀 Features

✔ Detect multiple faces in a single image  
✔ Draw bounding boxes around each face  
✔ Show total face count  
✔ Implemented in Python using OpenCV

## 💡 How It Works

1. Load an input image  
2. Use OpenCV’s face detector to find faces  
3. Draw rectangles around each detected face  
4. Count and display face count

This uses **classical computer vision** (not deep learning) for detection.
